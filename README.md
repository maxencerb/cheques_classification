# Bank Cheques Classification

&copy; Maxence Raballand 2021

The goal here is to try to classify cheques by banks (french banks here) with a pretty small dataset (~60 images). I will first start with data augmentation (blurring, rotation, filters, ...). Then I will try to create my own neural network in order to classify the images and then use transfer learning with an existing (pre trained) neural network.
